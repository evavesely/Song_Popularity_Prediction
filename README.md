# Song_Popularity_Prediction

This was a project developed throughout the entire semester of my SML312 (Research Projects in Data Science) class. My research question was whether it was 
possible to predict the popularity of a song using its acoustic features alone. For this project, I followed the data science life cycle by finding my own 
datasets, performing the necessary data cleaning and exploration, building baseline models, and optimizing my models with techniques like regularization 
and hyperparameter tuning. I used several Python libraries including NumPy, pandas, and sklearn's classification models.
